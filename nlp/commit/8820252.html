Impeachment is like charging you with a crime. So the House of Representatives charged Trump with abuse of power &amp; obstruction of congress.  Removal of office comes about when the House of Representatives vote by a majority to impeach on each charge (known as an Article of Impeachment), that goes to the Senate, and then by a 2/3 majority (67 Senators) in the Senate to vote to convict, and only then is the President is finally removed from office.  In other words, impeachment is like being charged by the DA for manslaughter, removal of office is when the jury decides you're guilty of manslaughter. The DA is the House, and the jury is the Senate in this analogy.  EDIT Instead of giving me gold (just DM me your potatoes), please take the time to check that you're registered to [vote]() and consider donating to the ACLU or [Fair Fight 2020](), an organization ran by Stacey Abrams (GA 2018 Gov nominee) that protects the right to vote. Fair Fight 2020 specifically focuses on fighting against voter purges.  EDIT 2  I keep getting asked whether or not a President that has been impeached and removed from office can hold office again. He cannot if the Senate votes as to do as such specifically (source 3)  Source 1  The Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 2](), Paragraph 5   The House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment  Source 2  The Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 3](), Paragraph 6   The Senate shall have sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.  Source 3  The Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 3](), Paragraph 7    Judgement in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgement and Punishment, according to Law.&quot;,0.8439,&quot;Just a reminder to everyone, unfortunately this doesn't mean he's not president anymore&quot;,-0.34,&quot;Rep.

From the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message Putin Interfered  David E. Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg  July 19, 2018  James B. Comey, James R. Clapper Jr. and John O. BrenN/A at a Senate hearing on Russias election interference in January  Drago/The New York Times  ByDavid E. SangerandMatthew Rosenberg  WASHINGTON  Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.  The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the . how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.  Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have uN/Aimously endorsed.  The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.  On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putins denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.  On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, Is Russia still targeting the  Mr. Trump shot back, No  directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)  Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, because hes in charge of the country.  In the run-up to this weeks ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.  The Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. BrenN/A, the . director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.  The . director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the Steele dossier. That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trumps activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.  According to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putins role in the election interference.  President-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American  Hodgson for The New York Times  They included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of theRussian intelligence agency formerly known as the  plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.  And ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putins own role.  That included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. BrenN/A had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.  Instead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. BrenN/A sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.  Mr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the . hacks.  The same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the . against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called hand-to-hand combat to dig in.  The pattern of the . hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clintons campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.  After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations  including the .  Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.  Mr. BrenN/A later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.  I was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election, he said in testimony in May 2017. And they were very aggressive.  For Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.  Mr. BrenN/A and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clintons loss in the election.  Mr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russias election interference.  Only Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)  President Trump, meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, said he accepted Mr. Putins denial of Russian election  Mills/The New York Times  And the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.  In March, the Department of Homeland Securitydeclared that Russia wastargeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.  Just last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were blinking red and called Russia the most aggressive foreign actor, no question.  And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy, he said.  Christopher A. Wray, the . director, also stood firm.  The intelligence communitys assessment has not changed, Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.  The Russian efforts are aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country, he continued. We havent yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.  Its a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.  Almost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russias election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.  He dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a witch hunt against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clintons home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russias role  and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trumps immediate orbit may have worked with them.  In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscows cyberskills were so good that the governments hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.  Since then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure  as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday  he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.  That is what happened again this week, twice.  Mr. Trumps statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.  That contributed to Mr. Trumps decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered  although he also veered off script to declare Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.  &quot;,0.9938,Worst president ever.,-0.6249,&quot;Its so disappointing that weve become so desensitized, if this were any other president this would be such a massive deal but instead its likely just another headline.

As op linked to  Before reading further  Here is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by Jaredlong  Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can &quot;&quot;spend&quot;&quot; that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.  pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons!

Just when the campaign was getting a bit quiet.,0.4201,&quot;So.... are you guys going to go riot or what?  I need to go to bed early tonight, but I'll stay up if you're going to get all smashy-smashy.&quot;,-0.3182,&quot;In Iceland, the leaked files show how Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson and his wife secretly owned an offshore firm that held millions of dollars in Icelandic bank bonds during that countrys fiN/Acial crisis .  The files include a convicted money launderer who claimed hed arranged a $50,000 illegal campaign contribution used to pay the Watergate burglars, 29 billionaires featured in Forbes Magazines list of the worlds 500 richest people and movie star Jackie Chan, who has at least six companies managed through the law firm.  efore dawn on Nov. 26, 1983, six robbers slipped into the Brinks-Mat warehouse at Londons Heathrow Airport. The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouses vault. Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash.  Thanks ever so much for your help. Have a nice Christmas, one of the crooks said as they departed.  British media dubbed the heist the Crime of the Century. Much of the loot - including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it - was never recovered. Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of Englands underworld.  Now documents within Mossack Fonsecas files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, Jrgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brinks-Mat plotters.   On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.  The following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove FiN/Acial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.  For those rights, Ove paid $1.  But the money trail didnt end there.  The same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.  It too paid $1.  In the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.  Family members of at least eight current or former members of Chinas Politburo Standing Committee, the countrys main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xis brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.  The leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their fiN/Acial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $ for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.  The worlds best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents. The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company Mega Star Enterprises Inc. This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi. His offshore dealings are currently the target of a tax evasion case in Spain.  &quot;,0.9186,&quot;Everything is going crazy in Iceland because of the scale of our role in this huge leak compared to our size in the world. The PM is heavily criticized for these corrupt actions and people are already calling for him to resign. There have always been a few rich and powerful corrupt individuals in Iceland and now they're finally getting exposed so I hope that will make a change in our government and other high ranking people. Only thing i'm scared about is the image of Iceland being ruined just like in the 2008 banking crisis and the volcanic eruption in Eyjafjallajkull in 2010.  Edit There will be held protests in front of the Icelandic parliament at 1700 UTC local time (1900 CEST). It looks like a few thousand people are attending the protests, including me.&quot;,-0.629,&quot;This is crazy.

Wow. It truly shows the excellent work done by all those journalists involved in this, keeping the leak in secret until now. I mean, it's quite astonishing to think all of the info they've had for so long and Mossack Fonseca had no idea about  what was going on.  &quot;,0.7783,&quot;This is the most terrifying thing I have read in a long time.  Whilst I dont think much of the bildeberg or the illuminati conspiracies, that all these influential individuals use one firm, to hide their wealth, do corrupt deals, and influence the world in such a large way, makes me wonder how many other firms just like this there are who have not had documents leaked.

I've lived in places in the middle east where the internet was not free and open. Where access was granted and denied at the whim of other people and you know what? It's fucking awful.  Now, the scope of what I am talking about is in many ways different from what the FCC is talking about here. It's not nearly as bad, however, I feel like there are some relevant crossovers to mention.  First of all, since there were no laws or policies in place to protect the customer, internet companies could basically do whatever the hell they wanted. Do you know why? Because they are basically owned by the state they operate in. 68% of Ooredoo is owned by the state of Qatar, Etisalat; the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world 60% of it owned by the UAE. So here is some shit they can pull. And this isn't just a problem in the middle eastern gulf, this happens in all kinds of places in the middle east that do not necessarily practise censorship.  First of all, they absolutely throttle your access to certain online services. For example, teamspeak. This is such a thing in certain countries it is hilarious. Teamspeak is a VOIP application for gamers yet for whatever reason, there are certain places where you just cannot use it. You will find yourself being throttled for the seemingly most random things and you will never know why. This is literally the kind of thing net neutrality protects us all from. Your ISP doesn't like the fact that a lot of people are using discord or netflix for example? Throttle the shit out of it or charge a shit ton of money. Oh this is the best one. ETISALAT LITERALLY BLOCKS MESSENGER, VIBER AND ALL OTHER VOIP SERVICES. Why? So that people can only use their own mobile network to call overseas. It is literally the most annoying thing ever. I cannot call my family in the UAE on messenger or any of those services because it is literally blocked so that they have to pay money to call on the regular phone network. What is to stop companies like Verizon or Comcast from doing this??  Censorship. Now yes, nothing about this FCC decision will come into the realm of censorship eh? But how can you be so sure? The fact that companies like ooreedoo and etisilat are primarily owned by the state, means that they have blocked all immoral content; porn websites, hell even things that aren't even porn but have someone dressed in a lewd manner. They have blocked any site that critiques their governments, sexual health resources for pete's sake, dating services etc.  Will there ever come a day where now that net neutrality has been done away with where partisan congress members can push for the restriction of sexual health services for example because it goes against their ideals? I mean what is to say that there won't be any collusion between government representatives and internet providers over the semantics of what is subject to heavier prices, access or restrictions?  This is of course assuming the worst, but we cannot pretend that people will not try to use this to their advantage. Not to mention that this pigeon holes people's free access to so many things. Let's say I am writing a paper for school and reach my limit for a certain database, website or whatever it may be. Then what? Am I supposed to move on to more sanctioned resources that I will have longer access to? Why? Why can't I just use what I want. What if I am an alcoholic and I come to reddit everyday because I am part of a support community. What will happen once I cannot come back here to talk to my community and I cannot afford to &quot;&quot;unlock reddit&quot;&quot;.  I try my best to see any redeeming qualities of doing away with net neutrality but I have already experienced the very bare minimum of it minus the censorship and it actually fucking sucks.  I am so thankful and privileged to have become a Canadian and to now be living in Canada. Sometimes we cannot really visualise just exactly how good we have it until we experience it about 1000 times worse. Please Americans, do not do this to yourselves, value what you have without having to learn just how much it means to all of you because it was taken away.&quot;,-0.7939,&quot;TBH all you net neutrality people should look to NRA for inspiration. It's not all about the calls, emails, tweets, forms whatever. Actually, show up to wherever these politicians are with signs and loud yells. Go to their offices, etc. Push the idea that if they let this shit happen they won't get re-elected. Make this sound like the issue and tell them that their actions on this will decide whether you choose them or the other candidate.&quot;,0.1655,&quot;I think this is a great opportunity for the big tech companies to form a foundation (with SpaceX?) to provide unfettered Internet nationwide.

First, they have to pay to enter the mall.   Then, they have to pay to visit certain stores. Best buy and target are $.50, but Game stop has a $5 fee to enter, Barnes and Noble has a $7 fee, the sports store is a $15 fee and Sephora has a $3 fee to enter. If you want to access all stores, it's $45.  Your shopping is capped at 10 minutes, anything more is $2 per 5 minutes. The stairs are free to use, but if you want to get to your store faster, you'll have to pay to use the elevators.   And the whole time you're shopping, some guy with a helmet head and plastered on smile will follow you around singing ditties about how cool the mall is while trying to curl your hair. &quot;,0.9473,&quot;Protest at Verizon stores  Good lord this is going from annoying to cringey.

Here, the canadian FCC is the CRTC, and this is the CRTC take on Net Neutrality   Why does the CRTC support net neutrality?  We believe that it is important that all Canadians have access to choice, innovation and free exchange of ideas. If Internet providers price content differently, they are, in a way, influencing you to choose certain content over other.  Thats why we decided that Internet providers must treat data traffic the same, regardless of content.  Internet providers should compete on the quality of their networks, by lowering their prices or increasing data allowances instead of treating certain content differently. If you are unhappy with the price and data allowance of your services, call your provider and negotiate or shop around! You have choices. Demand better.  Earing what's coming to the US next months makes me anxious  will the CRTC copy FCC ruling and chicken out on Net Neutrality sooner or later ?! Damn the stakes are high... &quot;,0.8791,So how many calls do they need to call this off?,0.0,&quot;Companies??? Treating consumers as nothing more than methods to increases their own wealth????

Godspeed!&quot;,0.7074,&quot;The only way to fight Net Neutrality is to quit your ISP subscription the day it passes.  Then protest in the streets nationwide for news coverage.  Honestly, the only thing they react to is money.  Yes!! we will get so much more now.  (NN is killed and 75% of their subscribers quit overnight).  They will scream at each other and flip it back so fast...  Only extreme actions to their money-streams are noticeable.&quot;,-0.7707,,0.0,&quot;Protest Idea MASS CANCELLATION DAY  Big internet companies are not fighting hard enough or at all for net neutrality.  Remember when Reed Hastings from Netflix suddenly didn't care about net neutrality?  What do you think about organizing a protest against their indifference/inaction with a day of mass cancellations.  If Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Amazon, Xbox Live, PSN, HBO, etc lost MILLIONS of customers in a single day with the promise that we are not coming back until NN is the law again, they would be forced to throw their full weight behind stopping this crap.  It could not be more obvious that our government is ignoring us while it inflicts great harm upon us for the benefit of ISPs.  It's time to speak with our wallets to people who cannot ignore the language of money.  These services will all be used against us anyway when Verizon and Comcast and the others can charge us extra or throttle them or just block them outright.  Sadly these companies and their money have more influence over our leaders than we ever will.  We need to force them into fighting for us.  You want our business back?

The WUC considers Chinas northwestern Xinjiang region to be East Turkestan, and sees its Uyghur Muslim inhabitants not as Chinese citizens but instead as members of a pan-Turkic nation stretching from Central Asia to Turkey.   The WUC is not a grassroots movement, but a US government-backed umbrella for several Washington-based outfits that also rely heavily on US funding and direction. Today, it is the main face and voice of a separatist operation dedicated to destabilising the Xinjiang region of China and ultimately toppling the Chinese government.  While seeking to orchestrate a colour revolution with the aim of regime change in Beijing, the WUC and its offshoots have forged ties with the Grey Wolves, a far-right Turkish organisation that has been actively engaged in sectarian violence from Syria to East Asia.  None of these links seem to have troubled the WUCs sponsors in Washington. If anything, they have added to the networks appeal, consolidating it as one of the most potent political weapons the US wields in its new Cold War against China.  From its inception, the WUC has been backed by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). With millions in US taxpayer money, the NED and its subsidiaries have backed opposition parties, civil society groups, and media organisations in countries targeted by the US for regime change.  Philip Agee, the late CIA whistleblower, described the work of the NED as a more sophisticated version of the old-fashioned covert operations that Langley used to engineer. Nowadays, Agee explained, instead of having the CIA going around behind the scenes and trying to manipulate the process by inserting money here and giving instructions secretly and so forth, they have now a sidekick, which is this National Endowment for Democracy, NED.&quot;,0.6302,Is this the same group that did this disaster of an AMA?  ,-0.7073,&quot;People up in arms about why &quot;&quot;Genocide&quot;&quot; is in quotation lmao but don't question this &quot;&quot;overseas-based Uighur group&quot;&quot;.

I've made many comments on this so I'll just summarize and provide sources.  1. The only source ever provided for &quot;&quot;over one million Uighurs in interment camps&quot;&quot; comes from a psychotic right-wing Christian fundamentalist named Adrian Zenz who can't read Chinese, based his claims off of eight interviews asking Uighurs to approximate what percent of people in their towns they think may have been in China's vocational schools, and utilizes unscientific methods. Most if not all of his work is not peer reviewed, and in the few cases are, . in the Journal of Political Risk, the editors consist of other &quot;&quot;China watchers&quot;&quot; exhibiting immense bias, also all citing the same uncorroborated, unverified, and largely if not completely speculative-at-best work of Zenz.  2. China's laws and legislation regarding religious accommodations have been strict in terms of protecting the right to practice religious faith, including that of Muslims. This has included requiring firms, factories, etc that have dormatories -- a system China has had for years which has been a large part of how so many people have gotten out of poverty in China -- to build food canteens that specifically cater to Muslim diets, as an example. A lot of this information can be found when looking at the sources for the ASPI report on &quot;&quot;forced labor&quot;&quot;, where all official government sources contradicts the ASPI's claims, and where all other sources are unverified, uncorroborated, reliant on &quot;&quot;testimonies&quot;&quot; which have been [highly problematic]() in [numerous cases](). Besides, in terms of religious provisions, it's worth pointing out that China has 39,000 mosques, 25,000 of which are in Xinjiang. For reference, Iraq has a higher population yet fewer mosques than Xinjiang has. That doesn't sound like &quot;&quot;genocide&quot;&quot; to me.  3. China has also been heavily encouraging of Uighurs to have their own autonomy, encouraging learning their ethnic language, having signs in Xinjiang that feature both Uighur and Mandarin script fairly equally, and so on. Most of China's internal propaganda has been about Xinjiang being a beautiful part of China, and has been about celebrating Uighur culture, and many programs in China have been about encouraging tolerance and integration. People claim China has tried to force Uighurs to marry Han Chinese, but there has never been evidence of that (and Chinese law prohibits forced marriage anyways); rather, China has encouraged relationships between Han and Uighur people. In other words, nothing China has done has resembled Fascist or bigoted nations; none of their propaganda resembles Nazi propaganda in disparaging Uighurs, and instead of propaganda about &quot;&quot;race mixing&quot;&quot; like the US had, they encourage healthy and tolerant integration and coexistence.  4. China's foreign policy with many nations has largely been positive, reciprocal, and beneficial. This has included providing medical equipment, medical aid, and masks to nations effected by Covid-19, being transparent about their actions in Xinjiang to prevent radicalization by the use of humane vocational schools and boarding schools, and so on. China has invited the UN, US, and many other nations to come to Xinjiang, and has allowed people to openly film Xinjiang life without issue.

The ASPI claims of &quot;&quot;forced prisoner labor&quot;&quot; is something I've debunked before, [here's a pastebin of my comment when it came up in news about 2 weeks ago](). Other examples of clear propaganda include [using a picture of a Brazilian shoe factory can claiming its Chinese](.)

Due to its size, health and age diversity  with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs  this grove represents &quot;&quot;the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,&quot;&quot; according to the group's president.  Known asAlder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet ( meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.  That age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.  &quot;&quot;Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,&quot;&quot; Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. &quot;&quot;In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.&quot;&quot; While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, &quot;&quot;it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.&quot;&quot;  SRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official  until now. There was the small matter of $ million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a publicfundraising driveon its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.   Alder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the . Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.  That won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.  As part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. &quot;&quot;This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,&quot;&quot; Hodder says. &quot;&quot;We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; - article excerpt&quot;,0.9963,,0.0,I am proud to say my donations went to help purchase this property.

There are a few things this article and the discussion of it get wrong  - Save the Redwoods isnt buying the entire grove, just the majority of it. There are still some Sequoias on private lots. - The land Save the Redwoods is buying has been publicly accessible for a long time. - I dont think it would be appropriate to say thatdespite the nameSave the Redwoods saved Alder Grove. Certainly there were some things done under Rouch management that probably arent best for the grove (. youre able to get pretty close to the Sequoias, which I think is bad for their roots) but the grove was by no means endangered by private ownership. This article says that the Rouchs logged non-Sequoias until recently, which might be true, but if it is I think they certainly did it in very small volume. Im hoping that Save the Redwoods will improve the health of the grove, but I dont know if that will work out. Ive heard that theyre thinking about building a visitor center and otherwise trying to get more tourists (. donors) to come up to the grove, and more visitation would probably be bad.

If it isn't already outlawed, the key issue is whether the person is &quot;&quot;seeking to win money&quot;&quot; or simply paying for an item that is selected at random.  I firmly believe that the only reason this is uncertain at all is because the law hasn't kept up.  If made aware, its more than likely that legislators would specifically cover loot box systems in the Act.  What is fucking outrageous  I know for a fact that winnings from loot boxes are technically taxable under the Income Tax Act, in rare and specific circumstances.  This would only be the case if you  1. sold the prizes for a profit; AND 2. had a &quot;&quot;system&quot;&quot; to reliably make a profit (as opposed to simply having a lucky streak).  This also means that losses (buying duds) would be tax deductible.  How can something like this be caught by tax laws but not by gambling laws?  I emailed the New Zealand Gambling Commission last week, and will call if I don't get a response soon.  I will be notifying the incumbent government too and see if we can't get some legislative clarity.  I think everyone should do the same for their countries (contact the gambling authority and the legislators).  If you're American, I wouldn't bother - your system is way too corrupt and it is a waste of time.&quot;,0.9815,But how else will I feel pride and accomplishment??,0.4137</span></pre></td></tr>

Also, because youre logged into Facebook in the container tab, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook container tab will not work.

Although the cancer returned in three mice, they again regressed after a second treatment.  The researchers saw similar results in mice bearing breast, colon, and melanoma tumors. Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors.  One agent is already approved for human use and the other has been tested in other unrelated clinical trials. A clinical trial was launched in January to test the effect of the treatment in patients with lymphoma.&quot;,-0.802,This is very good for mice.,0.4927,This is very very exciting.,0.5819,Isn't this the beginning to the plot of I Am Legend?

This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies]() have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address. 2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving). 3. From the paper itself &quot;&quot;We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment.&quot;&quot; Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already. 4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.

I don't know if it's because I feel hopeful that this looming, terrible disease that I've grown to be so afraid of might not have to be in my own future, or if it's because I wish this kind of research could have come sooner... I know this may not be the &quot;&quot;cure&quot;&quot;, or that it might not amount to anything, but this article makes me optimistic.
